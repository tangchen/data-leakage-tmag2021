# data-leakage-tmag2021

This repo contains the slides, code, and the toy dataset used in my talk on data leakage at the 2021 Technology and Measurement Around the Globe (TMAG) virtual symposium. https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/psy/tmag/

There is also a blog post based on this talk: https://tangc.net/math%20and%20stats/2021/05/31/tmag2021-data-leakage.html

Finally, shout out to Dr. Q.Chelsea Song for her comments and suggestions to an earlier version of this project.
